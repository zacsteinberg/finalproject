    <h1>Movie Data Analysis</h1>

    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

    <p>Movies are a form of entertainment that has existed since the end of the 19th century.
        They have evolved drastically, including sound, color, animation, and computer-generated images (CGI).
        At the same time, there have been different trends, including different genres being popular and
        different companies producing more movies. However, with all these changes, movies have remained a
        central part of culture worldwide. Just in the past year, the success of movies like Barbie and
        Oppenheimer were massive stories. They have won many awards, generated billions in revenue, and led to
        increased attention on each subject matter. Therefore, we want to analyze data from thousands of movies
        over the past century by performing time, location, genre, and popularity-based analyses. By
        investigating these topics and visualizing the results, we will better understand how movies differ and
        what drives popularity and success among different movies. </p>

    <p>Different metrics that we will use to analyze the movie data include popularity, number of votes,
        budget, release year, runtime, genre, and profit. We can measure success in movies by looking at those
        that have high profit and have a high popularity score with a significantly high number of votes.</p>

    <p>To learn more about movies and different metrics of success, you can visit
         <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">the IMDB website</a> and read
         <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/capstoneresearch/fall2022/315files_f22/team24.html">this study</a>
         from the Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

    <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

    <p> To answer our questions and complete our analysis, we found detailed data for a large universe of movies.
        The Movie Database is a powerful database that is useful for this task. We preprocessed the data to keep
        approximately twelve attributes for 6000 movies from The Movie Database released from 1916 to 2023, with a
        focus on movies produced in the 21st century. The primary attributes we use are budget, revenue, genre(s),
        popularity, number of votes/ratings, production country, release date/year, runtime, production country,
        and production companies. After loading the data, we saved the data in a Pandas dataframe with
        identifiable columns that we used for Altair, Matplotlib, and D3 visualizations. Through our data
        preprocessing, we also derived some new data points such as profit, main genre, and decade released.</p>

        <p>To improve our data visualizations, we performed preprocessing on the data. We dropped columns that
          were not relevant for our analysis, dropped any rows with blank data, cleaned up the formatting,
          and created new columns for our visualizations.</p>

        <p>The first dimension we wanted to examine our data on was production country, so we created an interactive 
            horizontal bar chart of the number of movies produced in each country. It allows you to select and 
            highlight the bars of individual or multiple countries in red.</p>

            <div id = "plot"></div>
              <script src='https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js' style="margin-left: -500px" ></script>
              <script src='main.js'></script>
              <div class = 'image'>
            </div>

            <p>In general, the vast majority of the movies in the dataset were produced in the United States. 
                This is due to the presence of Hollywood and how the entertainment industry is centered in the 
                United States. It is the biggest market for movies in the world as well, and if a movie is successful 
                in the US, it is likely going to be successful worldwide. Other countries that were among the top 
                producers include the UK, Canada, and Germany.</p>

        <h3>Profit Analysis</h3>
        
        <div class = 'container'>
          <div class = 'image'>
            <img src="images/profit_distribution.jpeg" alt="Introductory Website Image." width="50%" height="50%">
          </div>
          <div class = 'text'>
              <p>The above chart shows the distribution of American movies by their profit. We decided to only look 
                  at American movies because those were the most common by far of any primary production country. It 
                  is clear from this chart the vast majority of movies lose money and it is rare for movies to make 
                  a lot of money.</p>
          </div>            
        </div>
        
        <h3> The relationship between budget, popularity, and genre</h3>

        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>Next, we wanted to begin to perform our genre-based analysis. We first created an 
                  interactive bubble plot that shows the popularity of movies against the budget. The 
                  colors of the bubble represents the genre and there is also a radio so the movie genres 
                  can be analyzed individually. The size of the bubble represents the number of votes the 
                  movie received. When the user hovers over each bubble, it says the name of the movie and 
                  the corresponding revenue. Of note, we condensed the number of genres by grouping similar ones
                  together. For instance, the Action genre includes movies primarily classified as "action",
                  "adventure", "science fiction", and "fantasy".</p>
                <p>The chart shows that there is a decently strong correlation between budget and popularity. 
                  Additionally, vote count seems to have no impact on popularity and higher budget movies do not 
                  necessarily get higher vote counts. Lastly, we can see that most movies have a budget between 
                  $100-$200 million.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = 'image'>
                <iframe src="images/bubblechart.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>We have also created a stacked bar plot that shows the count of movies by genre produced in the 21st 
          century. It shows how there is been an increase in the proportion of action and horror movies while a 
          decrease in drama.</p>

        <div class = 'center'>
            <iframe src="images/stacked_bar_chart.html" width="85%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>Comparing Movie Length Across Genres</h3>

        <p>Lastly, we created an interactive chart that shows the average runtime by genre for movies in a 
          single year. The user can select any year between 2000 and 2023 using the dropdown to explore which 
          genres averaged longer in different years, and to see trends in average runtime for different genres 
          over time. For instance, documentaries consistently have the shortest average runtime almost every year.</p>

        <div class = 'center'>
            <iframe src="images/average_runtime_chart.html" width="95%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

        <p>In this visualization analysis, we explore what leads to the success of a movie and how they have differed 
          over time and across genres. Our analysis shows how the factors of runtime, profit, and popularity, among 
          others differ across genres.</p>

        <p>One limitation of our analysis was we only used the first genre in the list of genre classifications for 
            each movie to avoid overlap or repetition. However, this means movies that truly belong in at least two 
            categories (e.g., romantic comedies, aka romcoms) we could not categorize completely accurately. 
            Furthermore, our method of main genre selection was on the assumption that the first genre in the list 
            was the primary genre, which is most likely true, but we are unable to verify that with complete 
            certainty.</p>
